## Change Log for  ***disorder***
### v0.6.0
- The program structure is optimized and the performance is greatly improved, especially for the multinary site-occupancy.
- We have extended the ***fast mode*** of **v0.5.x** to the general cases, so the ***fast***-tag is discarded.
- When the atomic positions order of the doping site does not meet the requirement, the program will readjust the atomic positions order, and the new structure will be saved in **SPOSCAR_NEW** file.
### v0.6.1
- We have fixed the bug of degeneracy calculation errors in certain situation.
