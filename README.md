## What is ***disorder*** ?
- ***disorder*** is an open source software designed for generating irreducible site-occupancy configurations (i.e., symmetrically inequivalent disordered structures), which allows extremely efficient modeling of multicomponent alloys or lattice defects (e.g., substitutions and vacancies).

## Features
- Build supercell form arbitrary input cell with any supercell expansion matrix.
- Search space group operations of the supercell and identify its point group symbol.
- Generate irreducible configurations for the system with any number of atomic types and arbitrary stoichiometry.
- Count the degeneracy (the number of equivalent configurations) of each irreducible configuration.
- Save the the structure file of each irreducible configuration in **POSCAR** format.
